# Cloud Native Architectures Workshop

A hands-on workshop where participants will learn how to leverage Red Hat OpenShift and Application Services to design, develop and deploy modern cloud-native applications, based on real life use cases.

This workshop consists of a number different modules, each highlighting a particular use case, development principle or technology. The modules have a common overarching story, revolving around the e-commerce site of a fictitious retail company (Globex). Globex has undergone significant modernization and they are keen to build on their application modernization efforts to rapidly build new functionalities.

* The modules are independent from each other and can be taken in any combination or order. Each module consists of an introduction and an instructions section. The introduction details the business problem we are trying to solve, possible solutions, a technical overview of the proposed solution and other background information. The instructions provide details step-by-step details to guide you through the workshop.
* This GitHub organisation holds all application code for modules used in the Red Hat Cloud Architecture Workshops.
